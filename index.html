    <h1>Welcome to my Page</h1>
    <p>My name is Abishek Jayswal, and I am from Nepal, a country known for its rich culture and stunning mountain landscapes. I am currently 23 years old and pursuing my studies in the Bachelor’s in Information Technology (BIT) program at Laurea University of Applied Sciences. I have a strong interest in technology and enjoy exploring how digital innovations can shape the future. Outside of academics, I love spending time outdoors and playing various outdoor games, which help me stay active and balanced. I consider myself an enthusiastic learner, always eager to develop new skills and gain international experiences. Studying in Finland has given me the opportunity to grow both personally and professionally while connecting with people from diverse backgrounds.</p>
